# BOhT

in Italian, "boh" means "_I don't know_", "I don't understand". This is why we create "_Boht_", the first AI model for conversational agents that _understands misunderstandings_, capturing the user's idea of the chatbot (the mental model) and her/his level of expertise in the domain of the conversation.
